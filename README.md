# Wide Color Viewer


This is a test iOS app for identifying wide color in a live camera feed. [See this blog post](https://medium.com/@heypete/adventures-in-wide-color-an-ios-exploration-2934669e0cc2) for more context.

When you run this app on an iPhone device capable of capturing color in the Display P3 color space -- iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus or X -- it will capture a stream of images from the back camera and highlight the regions where color is outside the standard Red Green Blue color space (a/k/a "wide color").

It won't work on the simulator, so run it on a device!
